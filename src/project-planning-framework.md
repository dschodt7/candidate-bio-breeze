# Executive Career Catalyst Planning Framework

## 1. Current State Analysis
Before any changes:
- What is the current implementation?
- What parts are working well?
- What specific issue/enhancement are we addressing?
- What dependencies exist?

## 2. Change Impact Assessment
For every proposed change:
- Which files/components will be affected?
- What existing functionality might be impacted?
- Are there database implications?
- Are there API/Edge function considerations?
- What dependencies need to be added/modified?

## 3. Technical Constraints Check
Verify compatibility with:
- Browser vs. Server execution context
- Available libraries and their limitations
- Performance implications
- Security considerations
- Error handling requirements

## 4. Implementation Strategy
Detail the specific steps:
1. Database changes (if any)
   - Schema modifications
   - New tables/columns
   - RLS policy updates
2. Backend changes (if any)
   - New edge functions
   - API modifications
   - Error handling strategy
3. Frontend changes
   - Component updates
   - State management
   - UI/UX considerations
4. Testing strategy
   - What to test
   - How to test
   - Expected outcomes

## 5. Rollback Plan
- How can changes be reverted if issues arise?
- What's the backup strategy?
- How to maintain data integrity during rollback?

## 6. Validation Checklist
Before implementing:
- [ ] All edge cases considered
- [ ] Error handling defined
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Security implications reviewed
- [ ] Existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Dependencies verified
- [ ] Logging strategy defined
- [ ] Testing approach outlined

## 7. Success Criteria
Define what success looks like:
- Expected behavior
- Performance metrics
- Error rates
- User experience improvements

## Example: PDF Processing Enhancement

### Current State
- DOCX processing works well using mammoth
- PDF processing uses basic file.text()
- No cleaning pipeline for PDFs
- Text extraction quality varies

### Impact Assessment
Files affected:
- fileProcessing.ts
- ResumeAnalysis.tsx
- Edge functions

Dependencies:
- Need PDF parsing library
- Must work in edge function context

### Technical Constraints
- PDF library must work in edge function
- Memory limitations
- Processing time constraints
- Error handling for malformed PDFs

### Implementation Strategy
1. Database:
   - No schema changes needed
   - Add logging table for processing metrics

2. Edge Function:
   - Add PDF processing logic
   - Implement text cleaning
   - Add detailed logging
   - Handle errors gracefully

3. Frontend:
   - Add loading states
   - Improve error messages
   - Show processing progress

### Success Criteria
- Clean text extraction from PDFs
- No loss of formatting
- Fast processing time
- Clear error messages
- Detailed logging for debugging
